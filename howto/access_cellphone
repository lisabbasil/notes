Samsung Galaxy S6
=================

# Forget what's written below, use SSHelper
1) Install SSHelper app
2) Check configuration in app to get host IP (or use nmap to get IP when on same
   network)
3) Connect:
   ssh -p 2222 admin@"${ip}"
   Password is admin, too.
4) rsync \
       -e 'ssh -p 2222' \
       -avzz \
       --no-perms \
       --no-times \
       --size-only \
       admin@"${ip}":/path .
5) Interesting path's on your device might be:
   /storage/emulated/0/mystuff/ (= SDCard/mystuff/)
   /storage/emulated/0/DCIM/
   /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/
   /storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp/
   /storage/emulated/0/CamScanner/
   /storage/emulated/0/Download/
6) Check if your metadata got deleted as well. Recently, a file called
   DCIM/.metadata/HighLight.meta
   would use up all your space. Apps like thumbnail deletor might help. Or check
   Google Photos, and delete photos from there.

# With jmtpfs, very slow lately
1) Connect via USB, unlock device, click "Allow"
2) cd ~/mnt; mkdir samsung; jmtpfs samsung
3) If this doesn't work, you can try
   sudo mtp-detect
4) sudo umount samsung

# With go-mtpfs, not working at all
1) Connect via USB
2) cd ~/mnt; mkdir samsung; go-mtpfs samsung &
3) If it exits immediately, unlock device and click "Allow"
3) sudo umount samsung

# Use AirDroid, very unreliable
1) Make sure that both phone and computer are connected to same network
2) Open AirDroid app on phone
3) Note IP address on app, go to address with browser on computer

# Since all options are very slow and tedious, the best way I found is to get a
# list of files that you want to move and then always reconnect after each file:
cd ~/mnt
while read line; do
    echo "${line}"
    jmtpfs samsung
    mv samsung/Phone/DCIM/Camera/"${line}" ~/Downloads/
    sudo umount samsung/
done < files.txt

# Same procedure as for Samsung Galaxy S6 with AirDroid app, jmtpfs not working,
# but not really tested
